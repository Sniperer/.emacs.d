Improve grammar and spelling

** Ellama:
Here is the text with improved grammar and spelling:

Context:
Firstly, we consider the case when $z$ does not belong to $Z_n^*$. In
this situation, $\gcd(z,n) \neq 1$, since there are only three factors
of $n=qp$, namely $1$, $q$, and $p$, given that both $p$ and $q$ are
primes. Consequently, $\gcd(z, n)$ must be either $q$ or $p$. Based on
this computation, we can obtain the secret component $d$ needed to
decrypt ciphertexts.

Secondly, in the case when $z \in Z_n^*$, decryption is possible
following these steps with a probability of at least $\epsilon$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Call algorithm A as subroutine with input $(n, e)$ and $z$. If A
can compute plaintexts, we can decrypt $z$ with probability 1.
\item If A returns no answer, choose a random number $a \in Z_n^*$ as
plaintext and compute the ciphertext $b = E(a)$ with input
$(n,e)$. Call algorithm A again with input $(n, e)$ and $z' = zb \mod
n$. If A can compute plaintexts $c$, we know that $E(ax \mod n) = zb
\mod n$ by using the multiplicative property of RSA. We can then
compute the plaintext of $z$ as $a^{-1}c \mod n$.
\item If A returns no answer, return no answer.

\end{enumerate}

We should analyze the probability of step 2. Actually, since $z$ is
fixed and $a$ is randomly chosen, $zb$ is randomly chosen from the
entire set $Z_n^*$. Algorithm A will return an answer if and only if
$zb$ belongs to the subset $S$. So the probability is
$\frac{\epsilon(q-1)(p-1)}{(q-1)(p-1)} = \epsilon$. Thus, for any
fixed $z$ in $Z_n^*$, B can return the correct plaintext with a
probability of at least $\epsilon$. Q.E.D.
