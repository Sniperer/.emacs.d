check spelling

** Ellama:
I've reviewed the text and didn't find any spelling errors. However, I
did notice that there's a small typo in "Fix an algebraic structure
$\mathbb{R}$ and a set of polynomials $\mathcal{F} = \{F_i\}.$ Let $d
\geq 0$."

The correct notation for the real numbers is indeed $\mathbb{R}$, but
it's more common to write "Let d be a non-negative integer" instead of
just "$d \geq 0$".

Here are the four points as they were:

1. $D(1) = 1$
2. $D$ is linear, which means $D(X + Y) = D(X) + D(Y)$.
3. $D(Q\cdot F_i) = 0$ for any polynomial $Q$ and $F_i \in \mathbb{F}$
such that $deg(Q) + deg(F_i) \leq d$
4. $D(x_i^2Q) = D(x_iQ)$, where $x$ is a variable in $R[x_1, x_2, ...,
x_n]$ and $deg(Q) < d-1$.
