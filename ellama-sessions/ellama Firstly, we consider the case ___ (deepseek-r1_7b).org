** User:
Firstly, we consider the case when $z \notin Z_n^*$. In this
situation, $\gcd(z,n) \neq 1$, since there are only three factors of
$n=qp$, namely $1$, $q$, and $p$, given that both $p$ and $q$ are
primes. Consequently, $\gcd(z, n)$ must be either $q$ or $p$. Based on
this computation, we can obtain the secret component $d$ needed to
decrypt ciphertexts.

Alright, so I'm trying to understand this problem about decrypting a
ciphertext when the message z isn't in Z_n^*. The modulus n is given
as qp, where p and q are primes. Hmm, okay, so n is a product of two
distinct primes, which makes sense because it's often used in RSA
encryption.

The first part says that if z is not in Z/n^*, then gcd(z, n) ≠
1. That I get because Z/n^* consists of numbers coprime to n. Since n
= qp and p, q are primes, the only factors are 1, p, q, and n
itself. So any number that isn't a multiple of p or q won't be coprime
to n? Wait, no—actually, if z shares a common factor with n, it has to
share either p or q because those are the prime factors.

So gcd(z, n) can only be 1, p, q, or maybe even both? But since p and
q are distinct primes, their greatest common divisor is 1. Wait, no—if
z is a multiple of both p and q, then gcd(z, n) would be pq, which is
just n itself. So in that case, if z is not coprime to n, its gcd with
n must be either p, q, or n.

But the problem says we're considering when z isn't in Z_n^*, so
gcd(z, n) ≠ 1, meaning it's either p, q, or n. But if z = n, then
gcd(n, n) is n, but for any other z that shares a common factor with n
(other than 1), it must be either p or q.

But in the problem statement, they specifically mention that gcd(z, n)
must be either q or p. Hmm, so maybe when considering encryption and
decryption, we can assume that z isn't zero? Or is it about
plaintexts?

Wait, perhaps this is related to RSA decryption where certain messages
can cause issues if not handled properly due to the Chinese Remainder
Theorem.

Let me recall: in RSA, to decrypt a ciphertext c, you compute d = c^d
mod n, but there's an issue when c has common factors with n. Then
Euler's theorem doesn't apply because φ(n) isn't invertible modulo
something? Or maybe it does?

Wait, no—Euler's theorem says that for any integer a coprime to n,
a^{φ(n)} ≡ 1 mod n. But if a and n are not coprime, then Euler's
theorem doesn't hold because φ(n) counts numbers coprime to n.

But in RSA decryption, we have c = m^e mod n. Then d is such that e*d
≡ 1 mod λ(n), where λ(n) is Carmichael's function. For two distinct
primes p and q, λ(n) is lcm(p-1, q-1). But wait, if the message m
shares a common factor with n (i.e., m is not coprime to n), then
Euler's theorem doesn't apply because m^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n only when m is
coprime. So in that case, how do we decrypt?

I think this has something to do with the RSA-CRT (Chinese Remainder
Theorem) method where you split into two congruences and then combine
them.

Wait, but maybe for some messages, like if z isn't invertible mod n,
you can still compute d such that it works. So in that case, the
secret exponent d would satisfy different conditions modulo p-1 and
q-1?

Alternatively, perhaps when gcd(z, n) = p or q, then we can factor out
that common term to simplify.

Let me try an example. Suppose n = 5*7=35. Then Z/n^* is the set of
numbers coprime to 35: {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,15,16,...}. Now suppose
z is 5 or 7; these are not in Z/35^* because gcd(5,35)=5 and
gcd(7,35)=7.

If we have a ciphertext c = m^e mod 35. To decrypt it, normally you'd
do c^d mod 35 where d is the private exponent such that e*d ≡1 mod
φ(35)=24. But if m shares a factor with n (say m=5), then Euler's
theorem doesn't apply directly because gcd(m,n)≠1.

But I think there's still a way to compute c^d mod 35, even when m
isn't coprime.

Wait, but in RSA, the encryption is defined for all integers from 0 to
n-1. So if m shares a factor with n, it might not be invertible. But
how does decryption work then?

Maybe because d was chosen such that e*d ≡ 1 mod λ(n), and even when m
isn't coprime, the exponentiation can still yield an m.

Alternatively, maybe we have to use different exponents for each prime
factor? Like using p and q separately with smaller exponents? Hmm, but
in RSA-CRT, you compute c^d/p mod p and c^d/q mod q, then combine them
with CRT. So if m is 0 mod p or 0 mod q, does that affect the
computation?

Wait, perhaps for decryption when m isn't coprime to n, we can exploit
the fact that d can be adjusted based on whether z shares a factor
with p or q.

But I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to formalize this.

So given n = p*q, and suppose gcd(z, n) is either p, q, or 1 (if
coprime). But in the case where gcd(z,n) is not 1, say gcd(z,n)=p,
then z can be written as z = k*p for some integer k.

Similarly, if gcd(z,n)=q, then z=k*q. So perhaps we can factor that
out?

Let me think about what happens when you compute c^d mod n where d is
such that e*d ≡1 mod λ(n). If m and n are coprime, it works smoothly
via Euler's theorem or CRT.

But if not, maybe there's another approach. I remember something
called the RSA blinding factor; sometimes you can use a random
multiplier to make sure the message is coprime before exponentiation.

Alternatively, perhaps in cases where z isn't coprime with n, it can
be split into its prime factors and then handle each modulus
separately?

Wait, let me think more carefully. Suppose that gcd(z,n)=p, which
implies that p divides z. Then we have:

z = p * k for some integer k.

But since p is prime, in this case, the inverse of e mod λ(n) can be
chosen such that it's 1 mod (φ(p)/something). Wait, no—wait, maybe
using CRT would help here.

Alternatively, perhaps if I consider c^d mod p and c^d mod q
separately. Since z is a multiple of p, then when you reduce modulo p,
you get c ≡ m^e mod p. Then to decrypt that, since p divides n, we can
compute it as (m mod p)^e mod p.

But if p divides m, then m = 0 mod p, so c would be 0 mod p? Wait,
no—if m is divisible by p, but not necessarily q, right?

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Let n=35, e=3, which means d must
satisfy 3*d ≡1 mod 24 (since φ(35)=24). So solving for d: 3d≡1 mod24
=> d=17 because 3*17=51≡51-2*24=3, no. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, let me compute it properly: looking for d such that 3*d ≡1
mod24. Let's try d= 8: 3*8=24≡0. Not good. d=17: 3*17=51;
51-2*24=51-48=3≠1. Hmm, maybe e*d ≡1 mod lambda(n). Wait, for n=pq
where p and q are distinct primes, λ(n)=lcm(p-1, q-1).

So if p=5 and q=7, then λ(35)=lcm(4,6)=12. So in this case, e*d ≡1 mod
12. So for e=3, d must be such that 3d≡1 mod12; let's see: 3*1=3≠1,
3*5=15≡3, 3*9=27≡3, nope—wait, actually 3 and 12 are not
coprime. Wait, so e must be coprime with λ(n) for decryption to exist.

But if p-1 and q-1 have a common factor with e, then the exponent d
may not exist? Or is it that only certain exponents would work?

Wait, no—if n=pq, where p and q are distinct primes, then φ(n)=
(p-1)(q-1). But λ(n) = lcm(p-1, q-1). For RSA to be decryptable, we
need e and λ(n) coprime.

But in this example with p=5, q=7, so λ(35)=12. If e=3, which shares a
common factor 3 with 12? Wait, no—gcd(3,12)=3≠1, so actually, for n=35
and e=3, the decryption exponent d would not exist because
gcd(e,λ(n))≠1.

Wait, but in standard RSA setup, we require that e is coprime with
φ(n). So if p-1 and q-1 share a common factor with e, then it's
possible that λ(n) shares a factor too. Hmm, so maybe my example is
invalid because I picked an e=3 which isn't coprime with 12.

So let me pick another exponent where gcd(e,λ(n))=1. Let's take n=35
again, p=5, q=7. Then λ(35)=lcm(4,6)=12. So choose e=5: then d must
satisfy 5d≡1 mod12. Let's compute that.

Looking for d such that 5d ≡1 mod12:

Try d=5: 25≡1 mod12. Yes! So d=5 in this case.

So now, if I have a message m which is coprime to n, it works fine
with exponent e=5 and d=5 because 5*5=25≡1 modφ(35)=24? Wait no—wait:
φ(n)=24 for n=35. So 5d ≡1 mod24.

Wait, I think my confusion arises from the difference between
Carmichael function λ(n) and Euler's totient φ(n). For RSA to work
with exponents e and d such that e*d≡1 modφ(n), but sometimes you can
have smaller modulus as per λ(n).

But in any case, if we choose e=5 for n=35, which is coprime with
φ(35)=24 (since 5 and 24 are coprime). Then d would be such that 5d≡1
mod24. So let's compute that.

Looking for d: 5*5=25≡1 mod24, so yes, d=5.

So in this case, using e=d=5 is possible because they are inverses
modulo φ(35)=24.

But if n=35 and e=3 as before, which isn't coprime with λ(n)=12
(gcd(3,12)=3), then no solution for d. So perhaps choosing e such that
gcd(e,λ(n))=1 is necessary? Or else the system isn't set up correctly.

But I'm digressing a bit—so returning to the original problem where
n=pq and m=z is not coprime with n (i.e., gcd(z,n)=p or q). How does
decryption work in that case?

I recall that when decrypting using RSA, if m shares a factor with p
or q, but e was chosen such that it's co-prime to φ(n), then m^e modn
can be used to compute the correct message. But is there another way
without factoring z?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
in decryption.

Wait, so when using CRT for RSA decryption, you split n into p and q,
compute c1 = c mod p and c2 = c mod q, then solve for m1 ≡ c1^d/p mod
p and m2 ≡ c2^d/q mod q. Then combine them to get the message.

But if z is not coprime with n, say it's divisible by p, then when you
compute c1 = c mod p, which would be (m^e) modp. If m≡0 mod p, then c
≡0 modp as well because e ≥1. Similarly for q.

Wait, so if z is 0 mod p, then in modulo p computation, it's 0. So
when decrypting using CRT, you have:

c = (m)^e modn => c ≡ m^e modp and c≡m^e modq.

If m is a multiple of p, say m=p*k for some k, then m≡0 modp, so
c≡0^e=0 modp. Similarly, if m isn't necessarily 0 mod q, but depends
on whether it's coprime to q or not.

So in any case, even if z is not coprime with n, the CRT decryption
can handle that as it computes modulo p and q separately.

But how does this relate to the question about decrypting z?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a step-by-step approach.

1. *RSA Setup:*
   - Choose two primes p and q.
   - Compute n = pq.
   - φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1).
   - Choose e such that gcd(e, φ(n))=1.
   - Find d such that ed ≡ 1 modφ(n). So d is the decryption exponent.

2. *Encryption:*
   - Message m (integer), where 0 < m < n.
   - Cipher c = m^e modn.

3. *Decryption:*
   - To decrypt c, compute m' = c^d modn.

Now, if z is a ciphertext such that z = m'^d modn. If m' isn't coprime
with n (i.e., gcd(m',n) ≠1), does d still work?

Wait, but in standard RSA, m must be coprime to n for encryption and
decryption using exponents e and d.

But if m is not coprime to n, meaning it shares a factor of p or q
with n, then the encryption m^e modn may lose some information about
m. Because if m is 0 modp, then m^e ≡0 modp regardless of exponent e
(as long as e≥1). Similarly for modulus q.

Therefore, when decrypting c = m^e modn, even if m isn't coprime with
n, it's possible to recover some information about m. However, the
standard RSA decryption might not work because d was chosen based on
φ(n), but in such cases where m shares factors with p or q, maybe we
need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps CRT can still be applied as follows:

- Compute c/p = c modp and c/q = c modq.
- Find m1 = c/p^d/p modp. But since e*d ≡1 mod(p-1) (because φ(n)=
  (p-1)(q-1)), but actually, d was
